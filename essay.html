    <h6>Tic Tac Toe is a game that may seem fun and too easy and really is more of a challenge when learning important
      thinking skills. Sometimes the feel of playing a normal game is tricky which reveals the challenges. The O and X
      symbols represent another name for the game Tic Tac Toe which is Noughts and Crosses (University of Northern
      Iowa, n. d.). When we play, we are player X and our opponent is player O. Our opponent could be another player
      such as a
      friend if playing manually. Otherwise the computer can be our opponent if the game is automated. The game result
      for us can be either a win, loss, or a tie depending on how the game is played. Winning a game in Tic Tac Toe
      requires 3 of a player’s marks in a row in any direction; up, down, across, or diagonally (Exploratorium
      (Explore), n. d.).
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>
      The game is completely over when all 9 squares are occupied. If neither player (X or O) occupies 3 squares in a
      row, the game results in a tie. Being strategic at Tic Tac Toe focuses on how to get 3 marks in a row as well as
      trying to prevent our component from getting 3 marks in a row whether another player or the computer. After we
      place a mark (X) in a square, we should observe where our opponent (O) will choose and plan ahead based on that.
      It is possible our opponent can place 2 marks in a row and increase a chance of a loss for us. We may have to
      choose a specific square sometimes to keep the game going from a loss given our opponent has 2 marks in a row.
      Overall, this game focuses on skills where we pay attention and plan ahead based on conditions we act on and what
      our opponents give us (Exploratorium (Explore), n. d.).
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>Children as young as age 3 may play Tic Tac Toe, but often for fun competitively given they are unlikely to
      abide the 3-in-a-row of X or O in the square grid. While often that is the case, so is the result of both players
      winning if they both fulfill the 3-in-a-row rule in the grid. Players new to the game may need to be familiar with
      all possibilities of how to get 3 in a row. If the other player can observe a way to get 3 in a row, it can be
      very tricky for a new player to see the possibility right away. This tricky situation also applies to blocking
      approaches, so players may start developing 2-way approaches to try to win. The important skills overall reveal
      the planning ahead implementation with 2 or more moves.</h6>
